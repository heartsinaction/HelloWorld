1. What is the problem?
Many children and families from financially disadvantaged backgrounds face barriers that limit their access to basic necessities and opportunities for growth. These include inadequate clothing, limited access to food, absence of educational tools, and a lack of recreational and celebratory events that would otherwise promote confidence and community engagement. Additionally, underserved communities often lack consistent support from local organizations, leaving gaps in resources and services that are crucial to their well-being.
This contributes to disparities in education, mental health, and overall quality of life, creating a cycle of disadvantage that is difficult to break.

2. What is our mission?
Hearts in Action is a student-led organization dedicated to creating lasting positive impact in our community by organizing and executing year-round service initiatives aimed at addressing the needs of financially underserved individuals and families. Through community drives such as clothing, food, holiday gifts, and educational supplies, we aim to uplift individuals by providing them with essential resources while fostering an inclusive and collaborative environment for students to develop leadership skills. Our mission is not only to offer material support but also to create a culture of care, kindness, and social responsibility on campus.

3. How will we address the problem?
Our strategy for addressing these challenges will revolve around identifying community needs, coordinating service initiatives, and engaging the campus community through participation and leadership. Here’s how we will approach it:
Engage the General Body: At the beginning of each semester, we will hold a general meeting where students can propose and vote on the initiatives they would like to pursue. We will also collect ideas from different campus groups and organizations. We’ll focus on specific issues or underserved communities (e.g., children, seniors, unhoused individuals).


Initiative Selection and Planning: Once we have a set of ideas, we’ll break them down into actionable initiatives with clear objectives. For example, we may decide on a clothing drive for children or a food drive for local shelters. We’ll prioritize two to three initiatives every two months and dedicate efforts to their successful execution.


Forming Subteams: To streamline efforts, we will divide the general body into subteams that focus on different aspects of each initiative:


Promotion Team: Design and distribute marketing materials (flyers, social media posts, etc.), organize events to raise awareness, and drive participation.


Fundraising Team: Secure funding for operational costs (transportation, storage, event logistics, etc.) through small-scale fundraisers, partnerships, or sponsorships from local businesses and organizations.


Implementation Team: Handle logistics of donation collection, transportation, and distribution. This could involve coordinating pick-up schedules, setting up donation boxes, or organizing community events.


Collaborating with Local and On-Campus Organizations: Form partnerships with local charities, shelters, schools, or other campus organizations to ensure that the donations and services provided meet the most critical needs in the community. Collaboration will be key to ensuring the success of each initiative and building lasting relationships for future work.



4. Steps Involved in Initiatives
Clothing Drives
Identify Target Recipients: Work with local shelters, schools, and organizations to understand what items are needed most (e.g., professional clothing for job interviews, children’s clothing, etc.).


Set Collection Locations: Secure permission to place donation boxes in high-traffic areas (e.g., student union, academic buildings, dormitories).


Launch the Drive: Kick off the drive with an event or social media campaign that encourages participation. This could include partnerships with student groups, professors, or local businesses.


Organize Logistics: Ensure there are systems for receiving, storing, and distributing donations efficiently. This may involve renting storage space and planning pick-up routes.


Promote the Drive: Use social media, campus newsletters, and flyers to keep the campus informed and engaged throughout the drive.


Select Donation Partners: Partner with local organizations (e.g., shelters, schools, community centers) to donate collected items to individuals in need.


Food Drives
Partner with Local Food Banks: Collaborate with food banks and local charities to identify the most needed items and distribution points.


Plan Collection Sites: Set up donation bins across campus in strategic locations.


Create Awareness: Promote the food drive through social media, campus events, and word-of-mouth. Encourage students to donate non-perishable foods and canned goods.


Distribute Donations: Work with local organizations to ensure timely and efficient distribution to families or individuals who need it most.


Holiday Gifts & Celebrations
Identify Families in Need: Partner with local schools or shelters to identify families or children who may not have access to holiday gifts or celebrations.


Gift Collection: Organize donation drives focused on collecting specific gifts or funds to purchase presents. Consider asking donors to sponsor a child or family.


Host a Celebratory Event: Organize a community event to distribute gifts, celebrate with the community, and offer a sense of belonging and joy.


Educational Supplies
Identify Schools/Students in Need: Collaborate with local schools or after-school programs to identify which supplies are most needed (e.g., backpacks, notebooks, educational games).


Host Fundraisers: Use fundraisers or donation drives to collect both supplies and funds to purchase needed materials.


Distribute Materials: Deliver the supplies to local schools or organizations that work with underprivileged students.



5. Resources We Will Need
Donation Bins and Storage: Boxes, storage space for donated goods, and transportation to move items.


Fundraising Supplies: Venues, promotional materials, event costs (such as food for an event or transportation for donations).


Volunteers: We will need student volunteers to participate in each aspect of the project.


Partnerships: Establish connections with local businesses, campus groups, and community organizations to support drives and initiatives.



6. Timeline
Ongoing Initiatives: Host drives every two months, focusing on different needs each time (clothing, food, gifts, etc.).


Monthly Meetings: Hold regular check-ins with the general body and subteams to assess progress and brainstorm new ideas.


Planning Phase (1 month before the drive): Finalize the theme of each drive, set up locations, secure partnerships, and design promotional materials.


Implementation Phase (2-3 weeks): Launch the drive with a kick-off event, regularly promote it through social media and flyers, and manage logistics for collection and distribution.


Post-Drive Phase (1-2 weeks): Deliver donations, evaluate the drive’s success, thank volunteers and partners, and collect feedback for future drives.
